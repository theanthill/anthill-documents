# Governance

We Anthill Members run Anthill, we make decisions together and we evolve our community together. We together "own" Anthill.&#x20;

_"Blockchain and smart contracts are governance technologies that have the potential to provide higher levels of transparency while reducing bureaucracy with self-enforcing code. They can minimise existing principal-agent dilemmas of organisations and subsequent moral hazards. Tokens of distributed networks hereby provide incentives to automatically align interests in the absence of third parties."_

## CONSENSUS

We achieve consensus by voting. Our voting power is connected to our individual rank. Our [Ranking System](ranking-system.md) measures members' contributions to the community.

## REFERENDUM, CUSTODIANS AND TECH COMMITTEE

**Anthill members** (token holders) can submit proposals, for example on how to improve and evolve Anthill, or to finance a specific project, a festival, a movie and so on. Other members can vote on these proposals and once the quorum is reached the proposals go to Public Referenda, where the community can vote.

The **Custodians** (elected by the community) validate the proposal and if in line with Anthill Community Constitution, they make the required changes.&#x20;

The **Technical Committee** (elected by the community) checks the proposal if it is technically doable, checks for vulnerabilities and doesn't bring risks to the existing code.
