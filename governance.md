# Governance

We Anthill Members run Anthill, we make decisions together and we evolve our community together. We together "own" Anthill.&#x20;

_Blockchain and smart contracts are governance technologies that have the potential to provide higher levels of transparency while reducing bureaucracy with self-enforcing code. They can minimize existing principal-agent dilemmas of organizations and subsequent moral hazards. Tokens of distributed networks hereby provide incentives to automatically align interests in the absence of third parties._

## CONSENSUS

We achieve consensus by voting. Our voting power is connected to our individual rank. Our [Ranking System](ranking-system.md) measures members' contribution to the community.
