# Colony

Colonies are groups formed by people or organisations around a common interest. On the Anthill we could have a colony for photographers, for the London Photographers and so on, similar to Groups we have on Facebook. But we can also have the Musician Union (UK) as a colony.&#x20;

Those Colonies Names have a financial value. \
The Anthill will give those names out for sale as NFT at the higher bidder through our auction system. \
Those Names (NFT) can be resold or rented out, but 50% of the earning**s** generated by the resale or rent goes back to the Anthill Community. \
This is to remove speculative trading over the names and to give space to genuine groups and organisations.&#x20;

Each Ant account can own up to 5 Colonies but can be part of an unlimited number of colonies. For example, an Anthill member could have the colony of their company, of their art collective, of their group of interest (for example, NYC Filmmaker), of their music band. And can be part of any Colony present in the Anthill Community.
