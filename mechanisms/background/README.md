# Background

**The ANT Token** is an innovative solution that can adjust its supply deterministically to move the price of the token in the direction of a target price to bring programmability and interoperability to DeFi. One of the biggest issues of all current algorithmic stablecoins right now is utility. We are glad that ANT has use-cases right away.

## Algorithmic Central Banks <a id="algorithmic-central-banks"></a>

Although many wide variety of stablecoin mechanisms exist, The Anthill Protocol specifically uses an “algorithmic central bank” approach to manage the supply of tokens according to a predetermined logic. The algorithm is in charge of balancing stablecoin supply to a fluctuating demand, ensuring that the token price remains relatively stable. Further details are available under the [Mechanisms](../stabilisation-mechanism.md) section.
