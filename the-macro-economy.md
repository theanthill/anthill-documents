description: and where the Ant Token sits in the Crypto Market - long term vision

# The Macro-Economy

Our macro-economy is based on three principles:

1. We have a community that uses the token daily. Members join the community not just for financial gains, like the communities of investors in the DeFi ecosystem, where members are willing to abandon their community to join any new one that gives a little better return on investment. But our members join Anthill because we resolve severe and fundamental problems present in the creative industry.
2. The Ant Token utility isn't just for making money. Yes, token holders gain 10% a year from their investment and more if they use our DeFi tools, but the community uses the token to access our ecosystem, earn rewards, use the marketplace, finance projects, get UCI etc.
3. A stable and functioning community means a reliable investment, which would attract investors. The more investors see our token as a secure investment, the more they will buy ANTT, the more we mint it, and the more the community can finance their creativity. This increase in the production of content and service creates more value and growth. And the cycle continues.

Our Token could replace what, at the moment, the market needs the most, a reliable, stable coin. ANTT won't just be reliable and stable but be a Token which has a + 10% stabile value growth. Giving fundamental taggable utilities to the Ant Token with a real committed community would make this long term vision a real possibility.
