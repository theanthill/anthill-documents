## **Collective Intelligence**

Anthill is a collective identity. A form of intelligence.

**Anthill** believes in collective intelligence and the importance of collaboration. Sharing and remixing ideas is what is needed to achieve greater art and innovation.&#x20;

True intelligence is collective intelligence, one that does not just follow pure logic and rationality but one also that has the courage to explore feelings and emotions. \
Intelligence is more significant when it has input from multiple sources and has different realities to draw from.

This is only achievable by utilising our human diversities as the essential elements of our collective intelligence. Using our senses, experiences, emotions and interpretations of our divergent realities allows us to achieve a higher level of understanding. It enables us to see and understand what we couldn't grasp from one singular perspective.&#x20;

**At Anthill, minority and marginalised voices get loud and their contribution is honoured.**

By collaborating, we can connect with each other’s views and ideas allowing each of us to learn and explore numerous interpretations of realities. All these inspiring inputs are necessary for limitless creativity. Sharing and trusting foster new art and inspire innovation. &#x20;

We also need creative intelligence to help overcome many (political, cultural, social, finalcial…. ) challenges we currently face.\
