# The Anthill Project

## **The new way Creators Earn.**&#x20;

Welcome to the world's most inclusive and diverse home for Creatives. **Anthill is a Global Community** that gives financial support to all members. It's the place where creative minds can connect, collaborate and support each other.&#x20;

The **Anthill is a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO)** that has as objective to support human creativity.

Anthill is a collective identity. A form of intelligence.

## **Collective Intelligence**

Anthill believes in collective intelligence and the importance of collaboration. Sharing and remixing ideas is what is needed to achieve great innovation. Creativity is the source of every innovation. The creative process needs to be financially sustainable for the creatives. This means that the Anthill needs to build a new economy capable of achieving sustainability for the parties that want to contribute.

True intelligence is collective intelligence, one that has the courage not just to follow pure logic and rationality. Intelligence is more significant when it can have inputs from many sources and have different realities from where to gain insights.

This is only achievable by utilising our human diversities as the essential elements of our collective intelligence. Using our different senses, experiences, and interpretations of our common reality allows us to have a higher level of understanding. By collaborating, we can connect with each otherâ€™s views and ideas and explore all those interpretations of realities. All these inputs are necessary for limitless creativity.

Creative intelligence is needed to overcome the challenges we have in this century.

The Anthill is where we celebrate each other dreams, and we help each other to build those dreams. Anthill is where the dreams come true. Where the success of one is the success of everyone. It is where we give to each other and receive from one another.\
