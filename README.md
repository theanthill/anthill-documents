## **The New way Creators Earn.**&#x20;

Welcome to the world's most inclusive and diverse home for Creatives. **Anthill is a Global Community** that gives financial support to all members. It's the place where creative minds can connect, collaborate and support each other.&#x20;

**Anthill is a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO)** that has the objective to support human creativity and the industry around it.\
The creative process needs to be financially sustainable. Anthill has built a new economy capable of achieving sustainability for those that want to contribute.

Anthill is where we celebrate each other dreams, and we help each other to build those dreams. **Where the success of one is the success of everyone.** It's where we give to each other and receive from one another. \
Welcome to the contribution economy.

Anthill is a collective identity. A form of intelligence.\

## **Collective Intelligence**

Anthill believes in collective intelligence and the importance of collaboration. Sharing and remixing ideas is what is needed to achieve greater art and innovation.&#x20;

True intelligence is collective intelligence, one that does not just follow pure logic and rationality but one that has the courage to also explore feelings and emotions. \
Intelligence is more significant when it can have inputs from many sources and have different realities from where to gain insights.

This is only achievable by utilising our human diversities as the essential elements of our collective intelligence. Using our different senses, experiences, emotions and interpretations of our realities allow us to achieve higher level of understanding, to see and understand what we couldn't do from one single perspective.&#x20;

**On Anthill the voices from minorities get loud and their contribution is honoured.**

By collaborating, we can connect with each otherâ€™s views and ideas allowing each one of us to learn and explore all those interpretations of realities. All these inspiring inputs are necessary for limitless creativity. Sharing and trusting bring new art and more innovation. &#x20;

Creative intelligence is also needed to overcome the challenges we are facing in this century.
