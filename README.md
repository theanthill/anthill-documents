# The Anthill Protocol

The Anthill Protocol is designed by the [The Anthill](http://www.theanthill.io) team as the algorithmic stablecoin on Binance Smart Chain. Anthill is an innovative solution that can adjust its supply deterministically to move the price of the token in the direction of a target price to bring programmability and interoperability to DeFi. 

One of the biggest issues of all current algorithmic stablecoins right now is utility. We are glad that the ANT Token has use-cases right away.

Inspired by Basis and its predecessors \(Empty Set Dollar and bDollar\), The Anthill is a multi-token protocol that consists of three tokens: **ANT** \(the algorithmic stablecoin\), ANT Shares \(or **ANTS**, which holders can claim ANT inflation when the network expands\), and ANT Bonds \(or **ANTB**, which can be purchased at 1:1 rate when the network is in contraction and can be redeemed with premium for ANT the network returns to its inflationary state, above the $1 peg\).
