# Decentralisation - Blockchain

To make Anthill possible we need trust in ourselves and trust in the system that enforces and regulate the community and the token.&#x20;

This trust shouldn’t be given to individuals, because people can be corrupted and people could discriminate. \
The solution is to create a “machine” that we can trust, that cannot discriminate or be corrupted by anyone. A system that together we can improve and develop.&#x20;

To do this we need a technology that is censor resistant (unstoppable), open-source so that everyone can check the code and that is extremely hard/impossible to be hacked. \
This technology is called Blockchain.&#x20;

**Blockchain** is the only technology that can guarantee us full decentralization and autonomous functionalities that can constantly reward our contributions and enforce our agreements.&#x20;

### **We are building a Web3 application on Polygon.**

## **WHY POLYGON**

****[**Polygon**](https://polygon.technology) **** is the [**Eco-Friendly**](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-the-eco-friendly-blockchain-scaling-ethereum-bbdd52201ad/) **Blockchain Scaling** [**Ethereum**](https://ethereum.org/en/) platform that enables developers to build scalable decentralised user-friendly dApps with low transaction fees without ever sacrificing on security.

Polygon combines the best of Ethereum and sovereign blockchains into a full-fledged multi-chain system.

* It is able to fully benefit from Ethereum’s network effects
* It is inherently more secure
* It is more open and powerful



Over 7000+ dApps have used Polygon to scale their performance

### Polygon makes Ethereum accessible for all.

**ETH Compatibility**\
****Industry dominance, established tech stack, tools, languages, standards, enterprise adoption

**Scalability**\
****Dedicated blockchains, scalable consensus algorithms, custom Wasm execution environments

**Security**\
****Modular ''security as a service'', provided either by Ethereum or by a pool of professional validators

**Developer Experience**\
****Equivalent to Ethereum, no protocol level knowledge required, no token deposits, fees or permissions
