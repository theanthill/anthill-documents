# The Anthill Protocol

The Anthill Team designs the Anthill Protocol. The protocol is an innovative solution that can adjust its supply deterministically to move the token price in the direction of a target price.

The Anthill is a multi-token protocol that consists of three tokens: 

* **ANT Token \(ANT\):** the algorithmic stablecoin
* **ANT Shares \(ANTS\):** 90% held by the Community Treasury and 10% by the Anthill HQ. ANTS allow claiming ANT inflation when the network expands
* **ANT Bonds \(ANTB\):** which can be purchased at 1:1 rate when the network is in contraction and can be redeemed with a premium for ANT TOKEN when the network returns to its inflationary state, above the target price. With the ANTB, it's possible to mint Anthill NFTâ€™s, and holders have increased voting power.
