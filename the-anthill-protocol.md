# The Anthill Protocol

Anthill Team designs the Anthill Protocol. The protocol is an innovative solution that can adjust its supply deterministically to move the token price in the direction of a target price.

The Anthill is a multi-token protocol that consists of three main tokens and a time-locked contract token:

* **ANT Token (ANTT):** the algorithmic stablecoin
* **ANT Shares (ANTS):** 90% held by the Community Treasury and 10% by the Anthill HQ. ANTS allow claiming ANT inflation when the network expands
* **ANT Bonds (ANTB):** which can be purchased at 1:1 rate when the network is in contraction and can be redeemed with a premium for ANT TOKEN when the network returns to its inflationary state, above the target price. With the ANTB, it's possible to mint Anthill NFTâ€™s, and holders have increased voting power.
* **ANT Contract (ANTC)**: this is a long term staking token that gains an additional 5% per year on top of the 10% that the ANTT gains.
