# The Anthill Protocol

Anthill Team designs the Anthill Protocol. The protocol is an innovative solution that can adjust its supply deterministically to move the token price in the direction of a target price.

The Anthill is a multi-token protocol that consists of three main tokens and a time-locked contract token:

* **ANT Token (ANTT):** the algorithmic stablecoin that gains 10% of its value a year.
* **ANT Shares (ANTS):** 90% held by the Community Treasury and 10% by the Anthill HQ. ANTS allow claiming ANTT inflation when the network expands
* **ANT Bonds (ANTB):** which can be purchased at 1:1 rate when the network is in contraction and can be redeemed with a premium for ANT TOKEN when the network returns to its inflationary state, above the target price. With the ANTB, it's possible to mint super rare NFT’s, and holders have increased voting power when the network is in contraction.
* **ANT Contract (ANTC)**: this is a long term staking token that gains an additional 5% per year on top of the 10% that the ANTT gains.
