# The Community

Anyone can join the Anthill, but those that gain the most are those interested in creativity.|

**Anthill community is run by its members**, each member has voting power, each one of us can propose ideas and vote for them.&#x20;

We together can adjust and adapt our community to our needs and change everything we want. Implement new mechanisms, add and remove rules. \
Together we fully control how the Anthill DAO works.&#x20;

## ANTS (MEMBERS)

Anthill is the home for creatives and anyone that want to support creativity.\
To be an Ant you must believe in the power of contribution. The more you give the more you get.&#x20;

## VOTING POWER

Our **voting power** is connected to the contribution we give to the community. \
The more we contribute the more voting power we have. Doesn’t matter how famous you are, how rich you are or well connected you are. Doesn’t matter where you come from, your ethnicity, your gender or sexuality. \
Nothing matters apart from your contribution in making the collective intelligence grow. Create, innovate, contribute, help, facilitate, support, do the art you love and the Anthill will reward you for your contribution.

## CUSTODIANS

Custodians are voted by the community, they are community members whose role is to update the code and manage the day by day activities of the community.

Any Ant Member can become a custodian. To submit yourself as a custodian you must have a high level of contribution to the community, this is calculated by Anthill Ranking System (see [Ranking System](ranking-system.md))

The community at the moment has 3 custodians. The number of custodians will grow according to the size of the community. We follow the prime number to decide the numbers of custodians we have. ( 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23,... )
