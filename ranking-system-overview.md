# Ranking System

Each member of the community earns two coefficients: one representing the member's economic stake (i.e., ANTT token holdings), and one representing the member's community contribution (i.e., hours contributed towards the betterment of community goals). These two coefficients determine the distributions of Anthill Universal Basic Income UBI (passive income) and Voting Power in the community.

**Community Contribution Coefficients.** \
Each community member has a total community contribution coefficient, which represents the member's total contributions to eight different categories. Each member earns a category coefficient for each category, by accumulating points in that category. To give other members a shared understanding of community contributions, each member's profile displays a level for each category.

**Economic Contribution Coefficients.** \
Each community member has contribution economic coefficients, which are calculated by their stake and their financial contributions.

**The eight categories are:** \
• CAT1: experience, Experience LVL\
• CAT2: achievement, displays Achievement LVL\
• CAT3: content reputation, displays Content Reputation LVL\
• CAT4: service and product reputation (marketplace), displays Service Reputation LVL\
• CAT5: governance reputation, displays Governance Reputation LVL\
• CAT6: mentoring reputation, displays Mentoring Reputation LVL\
• CAT7: passive income, displays Passive Income Contribution LVL\
• CAT8: liquidity, stake and other financial contribution, displays Financial Contribution LVL.

**Voting Power and Universal Basic Income distribution** \
****UBI is distributed according to the community contribution coefficient. Each member earns this form of passive income as long as they contribute to the community. The more you give the more you earn. Voting Power is given in proportion to the member contribution. Higher is your contribution, higher your ranking and higher is your voting power

**Defining goals for the Ranking System** \

• Decentralization of \`wealth' \
• Fairness, equity, inclusion \
• Stability of ANT token value \
• Growth of ANT token value\
