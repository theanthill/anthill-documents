# Decentralisation

To make the Anthill possible we need trust in ourselves and trust in the system that enforces and regulate the community and the token.&#x20;

This trust shouldn’t be given to individuals, because people can be corrupted and people could discriminate. \
The solution is to create a “machine” that we can trust, that cannot discriminate or be corrupted by anyone. A system that together we can improve and develop.&#x20;

To do this we need a technology that is censor resistant (unstoppable), open-source so that everyone can check the code and that is extremely hard/impossible to be hacked. \
This technology is called Blockchain.&#x20;

Blockchain is the only technology that can guarantee us full decentralization and autonomous functionalities that can constantly reward our contributions and enforce our agreements.&#x20;

We are building a Web3 application.
