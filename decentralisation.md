# Decentralisation

To make this possible we need trust in ourselves and trust in the system that enforces and regulate the community and the token. This trust shouldn’t be given to individuals, because people can be corrupted and people could discriminate. The solution is to create a “machine” that we can trust, that cannot discriminate or be corrupted. A system that together we can improve and develop. To do this we need a technology that is censor resistant (unstoppable), open-source so that everyone can check the code and that is extremely hard/impossible to be hacked. This technology is called Blockchain. Blockchain is the only technology that can guarantee us full decentralization and autonomous functionalities that can constantly reward our contributions and enforce our agreements. We are building a Web3 application.
