# Metaverse

Anthill Metaverse is a gamified virtual and augmented reality environment with a token economy that keeps bringing benefits to the community.

A virtual world at the disposal of Anthill Members and Ant Colonies to do anything they like, from events to games, to exhibitions, live music, schools, parties... anything they dream of.&#x20;

Ants and Colonies may purchase from Anthill Community, **virtual plots of land as NFTs** and run their own activities on it. Plots can also be traded or rented out.

**Part of the Metaverse's land is reserved for communal use and is owned by Anthill Community and will never be sold.**&#x20;

There is a limited amount of land plots available in the Metaverse for sale, they can be purchased at Anthill Auction House. Every month for a three-year period, several plots of land are on sale until all the plots are sold.&#x20;

After this period the only way to mint (create) new plots of land is through our Edu System. Every member that gets a certified qualification through our [educational system](education.md), from level 1 to PhD, is rewarded with a plot of land.\
The size of the plot is in proportion to the qualification level and the market value. &#x20;

**Investors could finance students in exchange for the newly minted land or for part of it.**

Land plot NFTs are minted by Anthill Treasury. The Ant Tokens earned from the selling of the plots get burned (destroyed). This is the best way to contribute financially as the destruction of ANTT pushes the value of the ANTT up.

## **Land Distribution\***

There are 1,000,000 pre-minted plots of land and are distributed in this way:

• 30% owned by Anthill Community (not for sale)

• 64% on sale via the auction (three-year running sale)

• 3% goes to Anthill HQ Limited

• 1% get distributed to Colonies and Members that join the Anthill before the launch day.

• 1.5% get distributed as a reward to the liquidity providers that provide liquidity before the launch day and lock their LP token for 6 months.

• 0.5% goes to the Ants that participated in the MVP (experimental phase)

_<mark style="color:green;">\*those numbers are a reference of intention. Final numbers will be released before the launch day.</mark>_&#x20;
