# Metaverse

Anthill Metaverse is a gamified virtual environment with a token economy that keeps bringing benefits to the community.

A virtual world at the disposal of Anthill Members and Ant Colonies to do anything they like, from events to games, to exhibitions, live music, schools, parties... anything they dream of.&#x20;

Ants and Colonies may purchase from Anthill Community, v**irtual plots of land as NFTs** and run their own activities on it. Plots can also be traded or rented out.

**Part of the Metaverse's land is reserved for communal use and is owned by Anthill Community and will never be sold.**&#x20;

There is a limited amount of land plots available in the Metaverse for sale, they can be purchased at Anthill Auction House. Every month for one-year several plots of land are on sale until all the plots are sold.&#x20;

After this period the only way to mint (create) new plots of land is through our Edu System. Every member that gets a certified qualification through our educational system (_powered by_ [_Clock Your Skills_](https://clockyourskills.com)_)_, from level 1 to PhD, is rewarded with a plot of land.\
The size of the plot is in proportion to the qualification level and the market value. &#x20;

**Investors could finance students in exchange for the newly minted land or for part of it.**
