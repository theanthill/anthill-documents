# Metaverse

Anthill Metaverse is a gamified virtual environment with a token economy that keeps bringing benefits to the community.

A virtual world at the disposal of Anthill Members and Ant Colonies to do anything they like, from events to games, to exhibitions, live music, schools, parties... anything they dream of.&#x20;

Ants and Colonies may purchase from Anthill Community, **Virtual Plots of Land as NFTs** and run their own activities on it.&#x20;

**Part of the Metaverse's land is reserved for communal use and is owned by Anthill Community and will never be sold.**&#x20;

Land plots will be available to purchase on Anthill Auction House, every month for one-year several plots of land are on sale until all the plots are sold. Land can be traded or rented out.

After this period the only way to mint (create) new plots of land is through our Edu System. Every member that gets a certified qualification through our system (powered by [Clock Your Skills](https://clockyourskills.com)), from level 1 to PhD, is rewarded with a plot of land, the size of the plot is in proportion to the qualification level and the market value. &#x20;

**Investors could finance students in exchange for the newly minted land or for part of it.**
