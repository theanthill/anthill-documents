# Metaverse

Anthill Metaverse is a 3D virtual world at the disposal of Anthill members to do anything they like, from events to games, to exhibitions, live music, schools, parties... anything we want. \
Ants and Colonies may purchase virtual plots of land as NFTs and run their own activities on it.&#x20;

Part of the Metaverse's land is reserved for communal use and is owned by the Anthill Community.&#x20;

Land plots will be available to purchase on Anthill Auction House, every month for one-year several plots of land are on sale until all the plots are sold. Land can be treated or rented out.

After this period the only way to mint (create) new plots of land is through our Edu System. Every new member that gets a diploma, from level 1 to PhD, is rewarded with a plot of land, the size of the plot is in proportion to the qualification level.&#x20;

Investors could finance students in exchange for the newly minted land or for part of it.

Anthill Metaverse is a gamified virtual environment with a token economy that keeps bringing benefits to the community.
