# Getting Ant Tokens for testing

After you've followed all the previous How-To's and are connected to the Anthill Testnet with your wallet, you can request some Ant Tokens to test the website. To do this go to the Help page [https://testnet.anthillhq.com/help](https://testnet.anthillhq.com/help) and click on the **Get Free ANT!** button:

Accept the transaction on Metamask and once confirmed you will get a refill of up to 100 Ant Tokens, 100 BUSD and 100 BNB. You can always click on the button and will top-up your tokens up to 100 of each.
