# Token Economy

The Success of the Anthill Community is connected to the success of the Ant Token and vice versa. This aligns with the interests of everyone that is part of the Anthill Ecosystem.

**The Ant Token (ANTT) is an algorithmic token that gains 10% of its value a year.**

At every moment, the algorithm calculates the target price of the ANTT and decides if it needs to contract or expand the liquidity of the ANTT in the market (Liquidity Pool).

When the value of the ANTT is higher than the target price, the algorithm needs to expand the liquidity and, therefore, MINT new tokens (_In cryptocurrency, minting is a decentralized method that enables the_ algorithm _to generate a new token_).

## New-minted tokens distribution&#x20;

90% goes to Anthill Community Treasury, and 10% goes to **Anthill HQ**. (The UK limited company in charge to develop Anthill Community). The Anthill HQ spends these new tokens on financing new developments.

### **The 90% of ANTT that goes in the Community Treasury are utilised for:**

• Paying Rewards to community members (incentives).

• Investing in Community Projects.

• Our UBI (Universal Basic Income)

• Participating in the ANTT/UST and ANT/MATIC Liquidity Pool

• Increasing the Treasury Cash Reserve

• Purchasing of Digital assets (Bitcoin), having BTC is an extra level of stability for the ANTT. This makes the Ant Token not just an algorithmic token but one that is partially backed by Bitcoin.

**Community members can utilise their tokens in Anthill Marketplace, in the coworking and co-studio spaces, in the metaverse, in our learn by doing system or exchange them for traditional fiat currencies ( $ £ € etc.).**

## Micro Fees

There are micro fees every time a smart contract is used. Together with the other earnings made by Anthill Treasury, those fees are burned (destroyed to create scarcity) or used to purchase digital assets (BTC).
