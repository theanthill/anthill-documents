# Token Economy - Introduction

The Success of the Anthill Community is connected to the success of the Ant Token and vice versa. This aligns with the interest of everyone that is part of the Anthill Ecosystem.

The Ant Token (ANTT) is an algorithmic token that gains 10% of its value a year.

At every moment, the algorithm calculates the target price of the ANTT and decides if it needs to contract or expand the liquidity of the ANTT in the market (Liquidity Pool).

When the value of the ANTT is higher than the target price, the algorithm needs to expand the liquidity and, therefore, MINT new token.&#x20;

The new-minted tokens get distributed.&#x20;

90% goes to Anthill Community Treasury, and 10% goes to Anthill HQ. (The UK limited company in charge to develop Anthill Community). The Anthill HQ spends these new tokens on financing new developments.

### **The 90% that goes in the Community Treasury are utilised for:**

• Rewards paid to the community members.

• Invested in Community Projects.

• Are Distributed as a form of UBI (Universal Basic Income) to the community members.&#x20;

• Participating in the ANTT/UST and ANT/MATIC Liquidity Pool

• Cash reserve

• Purchasing of Digital assets (Bitcoin), having BTC is an extra level of stability for the ANTT. This makes the Ant Token not just an algorithmic token but one that is partially backed by Bitcoin.

Community members can utilise their tokens in Anthill Marketplace, in the coworking and co-studio spaces, in the metaverse, in our learn by doing system or exchange them for traditional fiat currencies ( $ £ € etc.).

There are micro fees every time a smart contract is used. Together with the other earnings made by Anthill Treasury, those fees are burned (destroyed) or used to purchase digital assets (BTC).
