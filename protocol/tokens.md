## ANTT - ANT Token

The ANT Token (ANTT) is a utility token designed to be used as governance for the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) **The Anthill**, as a medium of exchange, to pay rewards, and for purchasing products and services in the Anthill Marketplace. ANTT holders can have access to the platform, tools and services available within the Anthill Community.

In addition, ANTT holders have voting rights and the ability to create proposals to improve the protocol.

The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol deterministically expands and contracts the ANTT supply to maintain the ANTT Token to a target value of a 10% increase per year.

The ANTT has a starting value of 1 $UST token (which trades close to a single United States Dollar).

## ANTS - ANT Shares

ANT Shares (ANTS) loosely represent the value of The Anthill Protocol and trust in its systemic ability to maintain ANTT to be pegged. During epoch expansions (when TWAP - the time-weighted the average price of ANTT is above the target price), the protocol mints ANTT Tokens and distributes them proportionally to the ANTS holders who have staked their tokens in the boardroom.

ANTS have a maximum total supply of 21,000,000 tokens. 10% (2,100,000) is allocated for Anthill HQ while 90% (18,900,000) is allocated to the Community Treasury.

## ANTB - ANT Bonds

ANT Bonds (ANTB) help to incentivize changes in ANTT supply during both epoch expansion and contraction periods. For starters, the exchange rate for ANTT to ANTB is 1:1, but ANTB to ANTT ratio is dependent upon the mechanism as described here. When ANTT's TWAP falls below the target value, ANTB gets issued and can be bought with ANTT at its prevailing price. Doing so takes ANTT out of its circulating supply.

Contrary to early algorithmic, seigniorage stablecoin protocols, ANTB does not have an expiration date. All holders can redeem their ANTB for ANTT tokens as long as the Treasury has a positive ANTT balance, which typically happens when the protocol is in epoch expansion.

## ANTC - ANT Contract

ANT Contract (ANTC) is a long term staking token that gains an additional 5% per year on top of the 10% that the ANTT gains.\
You can swap ANTT for ANTC by using the ANTC Smart Contract which locks your investment for 3, 6 or 12 months. \
3 months contract gives +2% of your locked investment \
6 months contract gives +3.5% of your locked investment \
