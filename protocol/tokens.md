# Tokens

## ANT - ANT Token

The Anthill \(ANT\) tokens are designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol deterministically expands and contracts the ANT supply to maintain ANT's peg to 1 $BUSD token \(which trades closely to a single United States Dollar\).

## ANTS - ANT Shares

ANT Shares \(ANTS\) loosely represent the value of The Anthill Protocol and trust in its systemic ability to maintain ANT to peg. During epoch expansions \(when TWAP - time-weighted average price of ANT is above the 1 $BUSD peg\), the protocol mints ANT and distributes it proportionally to all ANTS holders who have staked their tokens in the boardroom.

Additionally, ANTS are used to achieved a completely decentralized on-chain governance where ANTS holders have voting rights and the ability to create proposals to improve the protocol.

ANTS has a maximum total supply of 21,000,000 tokens. 10% \(2,100,000\) is allocated for HQ while 90% \(18,900,000\) is allocated to the Treasury.

## ANTB - ANT Bonds

ANT Bonds \(ANTB\) help to incentivize changes in ANT supply during both epoch expansion and contraction periods. For starters, the exchange rate for **ANT to ANTB is 1:1**, but ANTB to ANT ratio is dependent upon the mechanism as described [here](platform.md). When ANT's TWAP falls below 1 $BUSD peg, ANTB gets issued and can be bought with ANT at its prevailing price. Doing so takes ANT out of its circulating supply.

Contrary to early algorithmic, seigniorage stablecoin protocols, ANTB does not have expiration dates. All holders are able to redeem their ANTB for ANT tokens as long as the Treasury has a positive ANT balance, which typically happens when the protocol is in epoch expansion.
