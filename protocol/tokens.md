# Tokens

## ANT Token

The ANT Token is a utility token designed to be used as governance for the Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(DAO\) **The Anthill**, as a medium of exchange, to pay rewards, and for purchasing products and services.

In addition, ANT holders have voting rights and the ability to create proposals to improve the protocol.

The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol deterministically expands and contracts the ANT supply to maintain the ANT token to a target value of a 10% increase per year. 

The ANT Token has a starting value of 1 $BUSD token \(which trades close to a single United States Dollar\).

## ANTS - ANT Shares

ANT Shares \(ANTS\) loosely represent the value of The Anthill Protocol and trust in its systemic ability to maintain ANT to peg. During epoch expansions \(when TWAP - the time-weighted average price of ANT is above the target price\), the protocol mints ANT and distributes it proportionally to all ANTS holders who have staked their tokens in the boardroom.

ANTS have a maximum total supply of 21,000,000 tokens. 10% \(2,100,000\) is allocated for Anthill HQ while 90% \(18,900,000\) is allocated to the Community Treasury.

## ANTB - ANT Bonds

ANT Bonds \(ANTB\) help to incentivize changes in ANT supply during both epoch expansion and contraction periods. For starters, the exchange rate for ANT to ANTB is 1:1, but ANTB to ANT ratio is dependent upon the mechanism as described here. When ANT's TWAP falls below the target value, ANTB gets issued and can be bought with ANT at its prevailing price. Doing so takes ANT out of its circulating supply.

Contrary to early algorithmic, seigniorage stablecoin protocols, ANTB does not have an expiration date. All holders can redeem their ANTB for ANT tokens as long as the Treasury has a positive ANT balance, which typically happens when the protocol is in epoch expansion.
