ANTB (bond tokens) are always on sale. However, a purchase during epoch expansion will result in a net loss. Hence, the platform UI only allows for the purchase of ANTB when ANTT falls below the target value peg.

To encourage the redemption of ANTB bonds for ANTT when ANTT's TWAP > target value and incentivizes profit-seekers who are doing bonds. Bonds redemption will be more profitable with a higher ANTT TWAP value, of which ANTB bonds to ANTT ratio will be 1:R, where R can be calculated in the formula as shown below:

**R = 1.0 + min\[ 0.3,( ANTT(TWAP Price) − 1.0 )∗coeff ) ]**

Where coeff = 0.65

**Example 1.** if ANTT's TWAP = 1.05,

R = 1.0 + min\[0.3, (1.05 - 1.0)\*0.65)] = 1.0 + min\[0.3, 0.0325] = 1.0 + 0.0325 = 1.0325

ANTB to ANTT ratio in Example 1 would be 1:1.0325

**Example 2.** if ANTT's TWAP = 1.10,

R = 1.0 + min\[0.3, (1.1 - 1.0)\*0.65] = 1.0 + min\[0.3, 0.065] = 1.0 + 0.065 = 1.065

ANTB to ANTT ratio in Example 2 would be 1:1.065

As you can tell, ANTB holders can profit more when they participate in bonds redemption when ANTT TWAP >> 1.z
